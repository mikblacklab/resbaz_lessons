## Congrats, you made a package...

 - These lessons are NOT going to teach you how to become R package maestros.
 - For that, please see Hadley's website (or maybe even buy the book):
    - web: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
    - pdf: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034421.do
    - paper/kindle: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1491910593/
 - There are a few more things worth knowing though... (and many of them I learned from Hadley)
 - Note that Hadley's approach to creating packages is based on some additional functionality provided by RStudio: we haven't explicity utilized that here (more later).
 
## What is in a package?
 - code: the R directory
 - metadata:
