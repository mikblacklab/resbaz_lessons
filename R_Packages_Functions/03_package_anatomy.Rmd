## Congrats, you made a package...

 - These lessons are NOT going to teach you how to become R package maestros.
 - For that, please see Hadley's website (or maybe even buy the book):
    - web: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
    - pdf: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034421.do
    - paper/kindle: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1491910593/
 - There are a few more things worth knowing though... (and many of them I learned from Hadley)
 - Note that Hadley's approach to creating packages is based on some additional functionality provided by RStudio: we haven't explicity utilized that here (more later).
 
## Aside - it's a package, not a library...

 - Just a minor pont:
    - package: the thing we just made (basically a collection of functions).
    - library: a place where lots of packages live (i.e., a directory in your computer's filesystem).
 
## What is in our package?
 - Code: the 'R' directory
 - Package metadata: DESCRIPTION file
    - developer info (that's you)
    - includes dependency infomation (packages, R version etc)
    - version number
 - Documentation: the man directory
    - Objects and functions
    - Use `roxygen` syntax to generate this automatically
 - Namespace: NAMESPACE file
 - RStudio project file: cats.Rproj (see next page)

## Aside - the RStudio project file

 - `cats.RProj`: text file created by `devtools`.
 - Don't edit it by hand - use the RStudio interface ("Projects" drop down - top right).
 - Have a quick look at the content...
 
## What else can be in there?
 
 - Vignettes: detailed user manual for the package - THESE ARE GREAT!
    - create with Sweave or Rmarkdown/knitr
    - include examples of typical workflows
    - `devtools::use_vignette("my-vignette")` to generate basic framework
 - Testing: the 'tests' directory (more later)
 - Data files: the 'data' directory.
 - Compiled code: the 'src' directory.
 - Installed files: the 'inst' directory.

## Package distribution

 - How can you share you package with others?
 - Build and send?
```{r}
## In R:
devtools::build('cats')
list.files(pattern="*.gz")
```

## Sharing your package

 - Easy to share aa version you package with others.
 - What happens when you change something?
 - Need a system that allows users to automatically update their version of the package, without you having to rebuild it and send it to them.
 - Perhaps time for some version control....

## Using Git and GitHub

 - Git provides the ability to track changes to the files that make up your package.
 - GitHub extends this functionality be providing a centralised repository where the evolving (and stable) versions of a package can be stored, and accessed by others.
 - The `devtools` packages provides an interface between R and GitHub, so that packages can be installed directly from a github repository.
 - We've already done this with the `roxygen2` package: 
```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("klutometis/roxygen")
```
 - GitHub repo: https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen
    
## The beauty of devtools...    
    
 - `devtools` has made package dvelopment and distribution simple
     - Previously developers had to release packages through an established repository (e.g., CRAN or Bioconductor), or host copies of the package source code that could be downloaded and installed.
     - Now the same tools being used to provide centralised version control (Git and GitHub), are also being used for package distribution.     
 - Even if you're only developing packages for yourself, the combination of `devtools`, `roxygen2`, Git and GitHub is a powerful development platform.
 - Now you just need to impliment some testing...
