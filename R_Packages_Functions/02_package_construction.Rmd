## Before we start

 - There is a perfectly good Software Carpentry lesson on creating R packages, but we will not be using it:
 
 http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/08-making-packages-R.html

 - Why not?  Because I had already written some of my slides when Murray pointed out that I had re-invented the wheel.
 
   - I'm sure there is a ResBaz-related life-lesson in there somewhere...
 
 - I really just wanted a reason to show you Hilary's "cat cup".

## Getting ready

 - To get started, we need to install the `devtools` and `roxygen` packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("klutometis/roxygen")
library(roxygen2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
```

 - `devtools` (Hadley Wickham & Winston Chang): Tools to Make Developing R Packages Easier
 - `roxygen2` (Hadley Wickham, Peter Danenberg & Manuel Eugster):  In-source Documentation for R

## Setting up

 - Use the `create()` function from `devtools` to set up a basic package structure:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
system('rm -Rf cats')
## remove.packages('cats')
```

```{r}
create("cats")
```

## What did that do?

 - Have a look at the "cats" folder, inside your working directory (you set that to a sensible place, right?) to see what the `create()` command did:

```{r}
list.files(path = "cats", recursive=TRUE, include.dirs=TRUE)
```

 - It made some files, and one (empty) directory: R.

## Create a function

 - Even though you've just spent ages creating funcions, lets make another one!  
 - A really simple on this time:

```{r}
cat_function <- function(love=TRUE){
    if(love==TRUE){
        print("I love cats!")
    }
    else {
        print("I am not a cool person.")
    }
}
```

 - Aside: look at how readable this function is!  We can figure out what it does without even running it.

## Try it out

 - Let's try it though, just for fun:

```{r}
cat_function(love=TRUE)
cat_function(love=FALSE)
cat_function()
```

 - That is pure fluffy goodness: I wish it was my function!

## Write the function to a file

 - We need to take the code for our function, and put in in a file in the "R" directory.
 - Having gone to all the trouble of creating the function in R, I can't be bothered copying and pasting it into a file: `dump` is a pretty useful command:
```{r}
dump('cat_function', file='cats/R/cat_function.R')
```
 - Now we've got some actual content in our package.

## Add some extra info to it

 - We've not quite ready to create our package yet - we need documentation!
 - Add the following to the top of your function file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' A Cat Function
#'
#' This function allows you to express your love of cats.
#' @param love Do you love cats? Defaults to TRUE.
#' @keywords cats
#' @export
#' @examples
#' cat_function()
```

 - The fancy syntax tells the `roxygen2` package how to handle our edits.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

x<-c("#' A Cat Function",
     "#'",
     "#' This function allows you to express your love of cats.",
     "#' @param love Do you love cats? Defaults to TRUE.",
     "#' @keywords cats",
     "#' @export",
     "#' @examples",
     "#' cat_function()",
     "")
write(x, file='cats/R/cat_function.R')
dump('cat_function', file='cats/R/cat_function.R', append=TRUE)
```

## Process your documentation

 - The `document()` command from the `roxygen2` package uses the information we just provided to generate proper R documentation for our function - how cool is that?!

```{r}
setwd("./cats")
document()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm('cat_function')
detach("package:cats", unload=TRUE)
```

## Install package

 - Now we can install our very basic package (it only has one function...)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("..")
install("cats")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
install('cats')
```

 - If you type `library()` you should now be able to see that the package is listed as being installed on your system.
    - perhaps we need a little more documentation....

## Test it out

 - Try using `cat_function`
   - Don't forget to load the library first... (might have to `rm('cat_function')` first)

```{r, error=TRUE}
cat_function()
```

```{r}
library(cats)
cat_function()
```

## Test your documentation

 - How does the documentation look?

```{r}
?cat_function
```

 - Perhaps a little sparse....

## Exercises

 1.  Add a description of what the package does to the DESCRIPTION file, and then reinstall the package.
 2.  Add (and document) a second function to the package.
