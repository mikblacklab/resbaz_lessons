## Attribution

Much of this content is adapted from Hadley Wickham's R packages book

and from Karl Broman

## Getting set up

This will carry on with the example from lesson 1

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('testthat')

library(testthat)
getwd()
```

change your working dir to 'cats'

## Initialise the test directory

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::use_testthat()

```

This creates

* A tests/testthat directory

* Adds testthat to the Suggests field in the DESCRIPTION

* Creates a file tests/testthat.R that runs all your tests are when R CMD check runs
