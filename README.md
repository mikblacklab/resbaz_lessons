A few comments from Mik:

Here's a quick summary of what is being taught, and by whom in the non-SWC sessions:
 - Functions and Packages: Mik and Murray
   - Creating functions (Mik): material taken from existing SWC lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html
   - Creating R packages (Mik): material taken from existing SWC lesson (probably replace the slides I've made with this - the matrial is basically identical): http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/08-making-packages-R.html
   - Testing (Murray): material from Murray, plus some material from Karl Broman's Tools4RR lectures ("Software testing and debugging"): http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/pages/schedule.html 
 - Data manipulation: Murray - uses existing material from Murray's SYSKA sessions?
 - Plotting in R: Murray, Mik & Tanya (is Mik needed?) - uses the plotting material from the sessions with the summer students in December?  Base R plotting: https://github.com/murraycadzow/R_tutorials/blob/master/plotting.Rmd
   ggplot2 material - https://github.com/smilefreak/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/ggplot2_tutorial.Rmd
 - Parallel R on NeSI: Tom - material on his repo: https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/resbaz-2016-NeSI_Rmpi_Demo
 - Building web apps in Shiny (Mik): need to generate this material.  Barebones example on Data Carpentry: https://github.com/datacarpentry/2015-06-30-FederalReserveBoard/wiki
